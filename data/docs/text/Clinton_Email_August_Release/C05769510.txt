Dear Cheryl -
He's going to call your          number. We're both hoping, on one had, that you're not there and you're at home. Please feel free to
call his cell phone              -- or he'll call you again on Monday. In the meantime, he asked me to pass along to you this simple
but heartfelt comment: "Please tell her I've never been prouder of my government. I mean that. Sincerely."

Cindy
