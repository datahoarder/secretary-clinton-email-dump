         Re: Libya internal strife


         SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
         European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.

                   1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
         Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
         Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
         the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jalil pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
         situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point, with a group of more than
         2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
         computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
         headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
         a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members and
         senior officials.
                  2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
         office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
         angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
         this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
         General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other
         western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
         to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
         Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
         that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd All to be more efficient in
         administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
         during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jalil warned el-Keib

              to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalila Belqasim Hefter in an
             effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
                       3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
             frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of his ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
             foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
             Hassan Ziglam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
             and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
             put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
             demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
             removing the former oil/finance minister Ali Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
             January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
             asked Abdel Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
             Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
                      4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglarn and Ngeb Obeda, the head of the Stock Exchange,
             to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
             services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
             situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with Bethej as
             the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
             frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
                      5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Haftar, stating that
             he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
             violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and organize.
             El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Keib gives the order.
             He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jalii will be unable to
             deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj and his
             supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in senior
             positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans and
             students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)
