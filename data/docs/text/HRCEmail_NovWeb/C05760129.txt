Cheryl,

In response to your request for a recap on recommendations on boards and commissions, in digestible form, here is an
easy one. Laura Pena and Barbara Adair did a great job investigating this Advisory Committee and interviewing
candidates. I have had some contact with some of the candidates, and I think this is an excellent slate. This committee
and the presence of                  will give State and USAID real credibility on these issues.
                                                                                                               B6

Re: Committee on Persons with Disabilities, FINAL RECCOMENDATIONS




I. Committee Nomination Status




The Advisory Committee on Persons with Disabilities has three vacancies at this time. Additionally, taking into
consideration the recommendations of committee Executive Director, Stephanie Ortoleva, we have conducted an
evaluation of existing committee members, and feel that reorganization is warranted, opening an additional two
vacancies for a total of five slots.


                                                                                                                  B6

Based on parameters above, we have conducted interviews and selected the five candidates detailed below. We believe
each bring diversity and innovation to the committee, coming from various careers, with expertise in a variety of
disability issue areas. Of our five candidates, two came through the WHL office                   two from the open
application process with the recommendation of the committee staff                          and one from both the
Obama PPO staff as well as the Committee staffs recommendations




II. Candidates:
