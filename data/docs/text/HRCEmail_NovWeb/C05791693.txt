Chris Seiple, http://www.olobalenciage.oro/aboutistaff/771-dr-chris-seiple.html sent the Secretary's remarks to
a wider audience, and said:
Really, it is the most significant statement on international religious freedom since the 1998

In response, Chris shares a reaction from person he describes as "an Islamist MB friend of mine:"
This is one of the most balanced and fair statements I ever heard from a U.S. official. Very informative indeed.

We saw immediate bounce on humanrights.gov and we will definitely be replaying the Secretary's remarks
Wanted you to know

Hi Julian,

I attended Secretary Clinton's speech today at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. The transcript is
below, with some highlights for you. Really, it is the most significant statement on international
religious freedom since the 1998 International Religious Freedom Act itself. Indeed, the U.S. has
never had a such a senior level statement. It highlights many of the conversations that we have had
at NP, especially regarding religion and security.

SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: Jessica, thank you very,
very
much. I really appreciate it.
[00:02:45]


Well, thank you very much. And it's indeed a pleasure to join you here today
to talk
about an issue that shapes the lives of people worldwide as much as any
other: religious
freedom. And I want to thank Jessica Mathews, not just for that introduction
but more
importantly for her service of many years, but in particular her leadership as
the president of
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.


You know, 15 years ago Jessica was writing about trends that were just then
beginning to get people's attention, like the rise of information technologies
and the creation
of global networks that existed outside governments. She said then that those
changes
would shape global events in ways both good and bad and that governments
would have to

adapt if they wanted to stay on top of global change. Well, she was certainly
right about that.
[00:03:49]


And indeed, I've worked to make the integration of new technologies and
outreach

to civil society groups and the private sector, diaspora communities and
other
nongovernmental organizations a hallmark of my time as secretary of state so
that it's not an
afterthought, it's not an add-on, but it is integrated into the work we do -
because clearly the
work we do will be influenced and affected by all of those nonstate actors.


I want to acknowledge two people: Michael Posner, our assistant secretary of
state
for democracy, human rights and labor, someone with whom I've had just
the great privilege
and honor of working so closely with over the last several years; and Suzan
Johnson Cook,
the U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom, someone
who I've also had
not only the privilege of working with in the State Department but in one of
my previous
incarnations as a senator from New York. Chris Seiple and Bill Vendley, two
of my top

advisers from civil society on this issue — I'm grateful for their efforts. And all the

representatives from Congress, from embassies, members of the Religion
and Foreign Policy
Working Group, and others who recognize and are committed to the
importance of this
issue and what it represents.


Now, earlier today the State Department released its latest International
Religious
Freedom Report. It opens with the words that guide our work and the work
of
governments and individuals devoted to freedom of religion around the
world. They are the
words of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And
listen to those
words again, because much of what I will say today is, of course, rooted in
our Constitution,
in our belief about the importance of the free exercise of religion. But it's
important to
remember that these words were adopted by the international community,
not just by the.
United States.


Here they are: "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience
and
religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and
freedom, either
alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his
religion or belief
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




in teaching, practice, worship and observance." Now, these are clear and
straightforward
principles that bring people together in both heartfelt unity and furious
disagreement. For
the United States, of course, religious freedom is a cherished constitutional
value, a strategic
national interest and a foreign policy priority.
[00:07:00]


It's particularly urgent that we highlight religious freedom, because when we
consider
the global picture and ask whether religious freedom is expanding or
shrinking, the answer is
sobering. More than a billion people live under governments that
systematically suppress
religious freedom. New technologies have given repressive governments
additional tools for
cracking down on religious expression. Members of faith communities that
have long been
under pressure report that the pressure is rising. Even some countries that
are making
progress on expanding political freedom are frozen in place when it comes to
religious
freedom. So when it comes to this human right, this key feature of stable,
secure, peaceful
societies, the world is sliding backwards.

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




Meanwhile, several countries with diverse faith communities are now in the
process

of navigating transitions toward democracy. They are wrestling with
questions of whether

and how to protect religious freedom for their citizens. This goes from
Tunisia to Burma

and many places in between. But take for example Egypt, which I visited two
weeks ago. I
had a very emotional, very personal conversation with Christians who are
deeply anxious
about what the future holds for them and their country. What Egypt and
other countries
decide will have a major impact on the lives of their people and will go a long
way toward
determining whether these countries are able to achieve true democracy.
[00:08:56]


So this is an issue that transcends religious divides. All faiths everywhere
have a
stake in defending and expanding religious freedom. I personally feel very
strongly about
this, because I have seen firsthand how religious freedom is both an essential
element of
human dignity and of secure, thriving societies. It's been statistically linked
with economic
development and democratic stability. And it creates a climate in which
people from

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




different religions can move beyond distrust and work together to solve their
shared
problems.


I've also ken how the opposite operates. The absence of religious freedom
can
create a climate of fear and suspicion that weakens social cohesion and
alienates citizens
from their leaders. And that, of course, can make it more difficult to achieve
national
progress. And because the impact of religious freedom extends beyond the
realm of
religion, and has ramifications for a country's security and its economic and
political
progress, more students and practitioners of foreign policy need to focus
more time and
attention on it. Today I want to make the case for religious freedom and why
all people and
all governments should support it. And I want to address directly the
arguments that people
who stand in the way of religious freedom use to try to justify their actions.


Let me start with what life is like for many who live without this freedom. In
the
harshest places, certain religions are banned completely and a believer can be
sentenced to
death. Strict laws ban blasphemy and defamation of religion. And when your
words are
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




interpreted as violations of those laws, you can be sentenced to death.
Violence toward

religious minorities often goes unpunished by authorities who look the other
way. So the
message is clear: If your beliefs don't have government approval, beware.


The same message is delivered by governments that seek the illusion of
freedom by
creating official state-sanctioned religious associations. They say, look, our
people can
practice whichever of these preapproved faiths they choose. But if people are
caught going
outside these associations to, form their own communities, or receive
instruction from their
own religious leaders, they can be imprisoned.
[00:11:48]


Religious freedom is not just about religion. It's not just about the right of
Roman
Catholics to organize a mass or Muslims to hold a religious funeral or Baha'is
to meet in
each other's homes for prayer, or Jews to celebrate high holy days together.
As important as
those rituals are, religious freedom is also about the right of people to think
what they want,
say what they think and come together in fellowship without the state
looking over their
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




shoulder.


That's why the free exercise of religion is the first freedom enshrined in our
First
Amendment, along with the freedoms to speak and associate, because where
religious

freedom exists, so do the others. It's also why the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights
protects freedom of thought, conscience and religion — all three together,
because they all
speak to the same capacity within each and every human being to follow our
conscience, to
make moral choices for ourselves, our families, our communities.
[00:13:08]


These rights give our lives meaning and dignity, whatever religion we belong
to or if
we belong to no religion at all. And like all human beings, and all human
rights, they are our
birthright by the mere fact of us being who we are — thinking, acting, human
beings, men
and women alike. They are not granted to us by any government, rather it is
the
responsibility of government to protect them.


Now this, of course, is not the view held by regimes that block religious
freedom.
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




They choose to see things differently. In particular, there are two arguments
they make to
justify their actions. Both are worth examining. The first is that only some
people should be
allowed to practice their faith, those who belong to the right faith. They
define religion in
such a way that if you do you believe what they want you to believe, then
what you are doing
is not practicing religion, because there is only one definition of religion.


They, and only they and the religious leaders with whom they work, are in
possession
of the ultimate truth. Everyone else, including people of the same faith who
diverge on
some interpretation of religious law or tradition, are wrong, heretical, infidels,
and they don't
deserve the protection of the law — they may not even deserve to live.
Because this is an
issue that inflames emotions, it can be hard to talk about it constructively.
You can't debate
someone who believes that anyone who disagrees with him, by definition,
disagrees with
God.


So let me simply say this: People can believe that they, and only those like
them,
possess the one and only truth, that's their right, though they do not have the
right to harm
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




those they those they think harbor incorrect views. But their societies pay a
cost when they
choose to look at others with hate or disgust. Human rights become real not
only in
interactions between citizens and their governments, but also in those
millions of ordinary
moments among neighbors and classmates, co-workers, even strangers on
the street.
[00:15:57]


Every time people choose tolerance and respect over fear and animosity, they
strengthen human rights for themselves as well as everyone else, because they
affirm their
shared humanity. That's how religious freedom — (coughs) — excuse me -
inscribe in law
becomes religious harmony, flourishing throughout a society. Now, religious
leaders have a
critical role to play in this process. And we need them to encourage their
followers — excuse
me — to embrace the principles of peace and respect, which are not only
tenets of nearly
every religion, but also at the heart of religious freedom.


And then, most importantly, we need leaders to affirm that respecting the
religious
freedom of others is in keeping with, not in opposition to, one's own rights.
When people
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




of all religions can practice freely, it creates an environment in which
everyone's freedom is
more secure. Leaders and governments, meanwhile, have their own
responsibilities. People
can think what they want, but governments have to act in favor of protecting
the rights of
all.
[00:17:22]


The world should and must hold governments to a different standard than
individuals. Whether they are secular or religious, Muslim or Christian or
Hindu or officially
atheistic or anything else, governments have solemn obligations to protect
the human rights
of all citizens, no matter what religions they believe or don't believe.


Now, some leaders try to excuse treating some citizens differently than
others by say,
but that's what the people want. They say they personally believe in religious
freedom, but if
a majority of citizens want to see a group locked up or thrown out of schools
or fired from
their jobs, well, doesn't democracy mean following the will of the people?
Well, the answer
to that is there's a big difference between democracy and the tyranny of the
majority. The
liberty that democracy provides does not include the freedom to do violence
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




to the equality
of all citizens before the law. That's why universal rights are often embedded
in
constitutions — they provide guardrails against laws that deprive members of
minority groups
of their rights.


When popular opinion supports restricting the rights of a minority, leaders
should
remember that they owe their people both their loyalty and their judgment.
Leaders should
lead and remind citizens that when rights apply only to some citizens and not
to others, that
is when principles are subverted to power, that sows the seeds for legitimate
grievances and
instability. Genuine democracies use principles to guide power and to protect
the rights of
citizens equally.


The second argument leaders who oppose religious freedom make is that
freedom is
a luxury they just can't afford — not yet, anyway. If laws restricting religious
practice and
expression were lifted, they argue, the result would be instability, a rise in
anti-government
sentiment, the fraying of social ties, more acts of vandalism, harassment and
violence.

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




[00:19:52]


Now this, by the way, is the same argument that leaders invoke to justify
clamping
down on political expression, press freedom or civil society groups, or any
activities that
question the status quo and reflect their citizens' democratic aspirations. But
in fact, long
practice and even academic studies show that it is the absence of religious
freedom that is
correlated with religious conflict and violent extremism.


There is also evidence that conflict is more likely when states have official
religions
and persecute religious minorities. That makes sense, if you think about it.
When people are
treated as equal under the law, hostilities among neighbors subside, and
social unity has a
change to grow — and so does trust in the democratic process, because
people are confident
that their rights will be protected, no matter who is in power.


In other words, religious freedom is one of those safety valves. It lets people
have a
say over important aspects of their lives, join their societies fully and channel
their
frustrations into constructive outlets. When governments clamp down on
religious freedom,
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




they close those safety valves. The result can be humiliation, discontent,
despair that has
nowhere to go — a recipe for conflict and extremism.
[00:21:24]


Now, some governments are coming to realize this. For example, in Libya,
since the
overthrow of Gadhafi, the new government has chosen not to enforce some
of his laws that
restricted religious activity, and they've enshrined the free practice of religion
in their interim
constitution and outlawed discrimination on the basis of religion or sect. And
earlier this
year, the Libyan Supreme Court overturned a law that criminalized insults
against Islam
because they have come to believe that the best way to deal with offensive
speech is not to
ban it, but to counter it with more speech that reveals the emptiness of the
insults and the
lies.


Now meanwhile, Egypt is grappling with these challenges as it navigates its
unprecedented democratic transition. And during my recent visit, I met with
members of
the new government, including President Morsi, and representatives from
Egypt's Christian
communities. Religious freedom was very present behind closed doors and
        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




out in the
streets. President Morsi has said clearly and repeatedly in public and private
that he intends
to be the president of all the Egyptian people. He has pledged to appoint an
inclusive
government and put women and Christians in high leadership positions.


The Egyptian people and the international community are looking to him to
follow
through on those commitments. But I heard from Christians who want to
know that they
will be accorded the same rights and respect as all Egyptians in a new
government led by an
Islamist party. They wonder, understandably, will a government looking
explicitly to greater
reliance on Islamic principles stand up for non-Muslims and Muslims
equally? Since this is
the first time that Egypt has ever been in this situation, it's a fair question.
Egyptians are
building a brand-new democracy. What it will look like, how it will work,
how it will handle
religious pluralism: Egyptians will be writing the answers to those and many
other questions
for years to come.
[00:23:48]


As I told. the Christians with whom I met, the United States does not take
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




the side of
one political party over another. What we do is stand firmly on the side of
principles. Yes,
we do support democracy — real democracy — where every citizen has the
right to live, work
and worship how they choose, whether they be Muslim or Christian or from
any other
background, where no group or faction can impose their authority or their
ideology or their
religion on anyone else; where there is healthy competition and what we call
checks and
balances so no one institution or leader gets too powerful and the rights of
all citizens are
respected and protected.


The Egyptian people will look to their elected leaders to protect the rights of
all
citizens and to govern in a fair and inclusive manner, and so will we. And if
voters make
different choices in future elections, then they and we will expect their
leaders to respond to
the will of the people and give up power. We are prepared to work with the
leaders that the
Egyptian people choose. But our engagement with those leaders will be
based on their
commitment to universal human rights and universal democratic principles.


    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




Another important aspect of Egypt's transition is whether citizens
themselves
respect each other's differences. Now we saw that capacity vividly in Tahrir
Square, when
Christians formed a circle around Muslims in prayer, and Muslims clasped
hands to protect
Christians celebrating a Mass. I think that spirit of unity and fellowship was a
very moving
part of how Egyptians and all the rest of us responded to what happened in
those days in
that square. And if in the years ahead if Egyptians continue to protect that
precious
recognition of what every single Egyptian can contribute to the future of
their country,
where people of different faiths will be standing together in fellowship, then
they can bring
hope and healing to many communities in Egypt who need that message.

[00:26:33]


As we look to the future not only in Egypt, not only in the newly free and
democratically-seeking states of North Africa and the Middle East but far
beyond, we will
continue to advocate strongly for religious freedom. This is a bedrock
priority of our
foreign policy, one that we carry out in a number of ways. Earlier today, the
United States
 did release our annual international religious freedom report. This is the

fourth time I've
had the honor of presenting it. It comprehensively catalogues the official and
societal
restrictions people around the world face as they try to practice their faith,
and it designates
countries of particular concern that have engaged in or tolerated particularly
severe
violations of religious freedom.


This report sends a signal to the worst offenders that the world is watching.
But it
also provides information to help us and others target our advocacy, to make
sure we reach
the people who most need our help. In the Obama administration, we've
elevated religious
freedom as a diplomatic priority. Together with governments, international
organizations
and civil society, we have worked to shape and implement United Nations
Human Rights
Council Resolution 1618, which seeks to protect people under attack or
discriminated
against because of their faith.


We raised these issues at the highest levels in international settings. I
personally have
discussed religious freedom in every region of the world, sometimes over and
over again.

We've appointed our first envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
We've
launched a strategic dialogue with civil society in which we collaborate with
religious leaders
and their communities to promote religious freedom, conflict prevention and
mitigation,
development and inter-religious dialogue. It includes a religion and foreign
policy working
group that has provided concrete recommendations on how we can
strengthen our approach
to religious freedom and engagement with religious communities.
[00:28:59]


Beyond diplomacy, we expanded our assistance to individuals under attack
because
of their religious beliefs, and to human rights activists working in hostile
environments to
promote religious freedom. These men and women are doing vital, often
dangerous work
with great courage. And we are proud to stand with them.


As part of our human rights dialogue with China, for example, we've taken
Chinese
officials on site visits to see how religious originations in our country provide
valuable social
services. We organized a visit to a Catholic charity that provides help to
people with

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




intellectual disabilities, an organization that fights discrimination against
Arab-Americans and
more.


We're also taking the message of tolerance and inclusion to young people. A
few
years ago, Hannah Rosenthal, our special envoy to monitor and combat anti-
Semitism, and
Farah Pandith, our special representative to Muslim communities, attended
an OSCE
tolerance summit together, and they came away with an idea. They began
asking young
people to pledge to spend just one hour working with people who don't look
like them or
pray like them. Jews were encouraged to volunteer to clean a mosque,
Muslims to volunteer
to help elderly Christians get to church, and many other examples. The
campaign, now
called 2012 Hours Against Hate, has elicited commitments from young
people around the
world to spend tens of thousands of hours walking in someone else's shoes.
It's even
become one of the London Olympics' official initiatives.
[00:30:49]


And, you know, that's something we all have a responsibility to do. Seven
years ago,

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




when I was a senator, I spoke at a dinner on religious liberty. And I
challenged everyone
there to think of ways that we could personally further religious freedom,
including, in the

words of Eleanor Roosevelt, in those small places close to home. I said it was
up to each of
us to ensure that our nation, which has always been an exemplar of religious
freedom,
continues to be.


Our mission is as important today as it has ever been. The United States was
                                               ,




founded, amongst others, by people fleeing religious persecution who
dreamed of a place
where they could live according to their beliefs, without fear, without shame,
without the
need to hide. And today, we are that place. With all of our challenges, there is
no doubting
the importance of religion to the vast majority of Americans or to the fact
that people of all
faiths and people of no faith live in America openly and at peace with each
other. The
religious life of our nation is vibrant and alive, and that has been possible
because of our
citizens' capacity over time for tolerance and respect, but also because of the
work of our
government, all three branches, to uphold our constitution, to take
extraordinary care not to

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




favor one religion over another and to protect equally the rights of all.
[00:32:42]


This has required perpetual vigilance and effort. And we all know there
have been

clashes and stumbles and vigorous, impassioned debate
along the way. We are still searching
for and moving toward that more perfect union. Of course,
we, like any non-divine entity,
are not perfect. But we should be proud and grateful for
the wisdom of our founders and
for the diligence of those who came after to protect this
essential freedom. It is rare in this
world, but it shouldn't be, because people aren't asking for
much. They just want to worship
their god and raise their children and make their homes
and honor their ancestors and
mourn their loved ones in a way that speaks to their hearts
and reflects their beliefs. What
could be more fundamental to human dignity than that?


That is what religious freedom makes possible, and that is
why the United States will
always stand for the value, the principle, that religious
freedom represents, not only for us,
but for people everywhere. It is not only a value that we
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




enshrined in our constitution, but
we know from long experience it goes right to the heart of
the stability and security of so
many countries in the world. And in this interconnected
world we live in, that means it
affects the security and stability of the United States of
America. So thank you for
understanding the importance of this value and principle,
and I hope for seeking ways, that
we all can continue to further it, to protect it and to spread
it.
Thank you very much. (Applause.)


Q: Thank you. Thank you so much, Madam Secretary, for
what you do in the world
and for our United States. My name is Samia Harris and I'm
Egyptian-American, and thank
you very much for caring about Egypt. I'm the founder of
Democracy for Egypt. And so
my question to you, Madam, is it's not only the Christians
that are worried in Egypt; the
liberals are, too. And I don't know if you have read the last
report from — (inaudible) — el-
Tahrir (ph) that the change for Egypt, it's really is asking
President Morsi right now that he is

   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




not delivering what he promised in forming the new
government. And you have mentioned
that you will be observing closely and there would be steps
to be taken — if you can enlighten
us on what's next. Thank you so much for your effort.

SEC. CLINTON: Well, thank you. And, you know, let me start by saying
that I do
recognize that a democratic transition is a complicated one for any country.
And in all
humility, it took us quite some time to get it right, to include all of our
citizens, starting with
African-Americans and women and — to really fulfill not only the letter of
our constitution,
but the aspirations of our people.


So as I monitor what is happening in Egypt, I am conscious of how
challenging it is
to get off on the right footing, to be absolutely clear what your principles and
values are.
And as you're aware, there was certainly a very concerted effort by the
president and the
Freedom and Justice Party and other associated with it, including the Muslim
Brotherhood,
to make commitments about the kind of inclusivity that the government
would represent,
the respect that all Egyptians would be held in, and the protection of the
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




rights of all
Egyptians.
[00:37:54]


Now we are waiting to see how that gets translated into action. And we are
certainly
aware of the forming of the new government, with the announcement of a
new prime    .




minister. We're waiting to see who's in that government. That will be an
important step
along the way. We are looking for ways to try to support the government,
particularly in
fulfilling the economic aspirations of all Egyptians. But we are going to judge
by actions, not
words. And the actions are really just at the very beginning stages.


I think it's important to make absolutely clear to everyone that we are not
supporting
any individual party or any individual. There seems to be a view on the part
of some that we
are. But that is not the case, never has been the case. We have supported a
transition that
we hope does lead to a democracy, which, as we have made clear, is not just
about elections.
I think there were mistakes in the past in some of the ways that we
shorthanded our support
for democracy in our country that people thought, OK, let's have an election;
     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




then we're a
democracy and maybe we never have to have another one. (Laughter.) You
know, one
election one time and that's it; we don't have to be held to any standard
about how we
actually continue to reach out and include people and respect people. And
I've tried to make
it very clear that that is not the case, that an election is not a democracy
make.
[00:39:41]


So we're emphasizing the independence of the press, the freedom of
expression, the
freedom of religion, respect for minorities, the kinds of things that we have
learned over
many years of practice, now, are what sustains a democracy. And we're
hoping that as the -
as Egypt adopts a new constitution, as it votes again for a parliament, as its
government
takes office, we will see a recognition, a commitment to what we view as
essential for
democracy to be sustainable.


Now, I am concerned that respect for religious freedom is, you know, quite
tenuous.
And I don't know that that's going to quickly be resolved, but since 2011 and
the fall of the

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




Mubarak regime, sectarian violence has increased; attacks on Christians and
Muslims,
sectarian violence from both communities has cost lives. And we don't think
that there has
been a consistent commitment to investigate and to apply the laws equally to
the
perpetrators of such violence.


That then sends a message to the minority community in particular, but to
the larger
community, that there is not going to be any consequences for acting out
one's own religious
prejudices or social insecurities. And that's the kind of recipe that can quickly
get out of
control in terms of conflict and also undermine the new democracy. So I am
urging the
Egyptian government at all levels to respect the rights of all Egyptians.


And I'm urging those who are concerned, not only Christians but also
moderates,
liberals, secularists, to organize themselves. I mean, this is something that I
started talking to
the Tahrir Square veterans about shortly after the fall of Mubarak, that it's
been my
experience that when democratic space opens up, when freedom opens up in
authdritarian
regimes falling, those who are unorganized will not be successful. How's that
for a
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




profound statement? (Laughter.) But all too often, people who are in the
moderate, liberal

world don't have the same commitment to organization and follow-through
and those

whose beliefs are so certain that they know exactly what they're going to try
to achieve.
[00:42:56]


So there is the religious dimension, the constitutional inclusivity dimension,
but there
is also the political dimension, that in a democracy, you have to get out there
and work to
elect people who represent your views. And otherwise you are going to be
sidelined. So it is
— it is my hope that as we judge Egypt's leaders by their actions, that
Egyptian activists really
get more focused on how to influence the government themselves. And I
know this is a
long haul, but that's the way democracy works. It doesn't happen overnight.


Q: Religion sometimes mixed with some other issues like terrorism and
separatism.
And the terrorists and the separatists (usually ?) takes religion as a tool to
mobilize

supporters. So how to balance the (demand ?) of (practice ?) religion —
religious freedom
and counterterrorism or — as well as counter separatism? Thank you.

[00:44:22]


SEC. CLINTON: That's an important question, because oftentimes when we
talk
about religious freedom, there is a tendency for people to worry about the
free exercise of
religion somehow supporting terrorists and separatists. I have a — the -
almost the opposite
view. I think the more respect there is for the freedom of religion, the more
people will find
useful ways to participate in their societies. If they feel suppressed, if there is
not that safety
valve that they can exercise their own religion, they then oftentimes feel such
anger, despair
that they turn to violence; they become extremists.


Now, there will always be people in nearly every society who are going to
believe that
God is talking right to them and saying, you know, what you really need to
do is overthrow
the government. (Chuckles.) What you really need to do is to kill the
unbelievers. What
you really — there will be people like that. But we're talking about organizing
society for the
vast majority of people, having people who exercise their religious beliefs
lawfully, protected
by the law, and people who engage in violence, harassment; intimidation or
other anti-social
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




criminal behavior punished by the law. But one should not be punished or
harassed merely

because of who one is or what one believes, unless there are actions
associated with that.
And that often is the difficult rub in many areas when we talk about religious
                          ,




freedom.
[00:46:19]


You know, and it's not just religions against one another; it is even within
religions.
Within Christianity, within Judaism, within, you know, Islam, which
Hinduism, there are
people who believe their version of that religion is the only right way to
believe. And so in
some of the countries we are most concerned about that are majority Muslim
countries, it's
the intimidation and violence against Muslims who are in minority sects that
we most worry.
about. We watched for many years the conflict in Northern Ireland against
Catholics on the
one side, Protestants on the other.


So I think you're right that there always are issues about terrorism, about
separatism,
but those should be dealt with under the law without infringing on the rights
of people
whose religious beliefs are different from the majority. So I hope that
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




governments can
begin to make those distinctions.
[00:47:35]


And it's not only important to do because you don't want to breed
extremism, which
you can do by cracking down on religion, especially if it's associated with a
different ethnic
group or tribal group, other identifying characteristics, but it's also because if
you're not
careful, people will feel that they are in a life-or-death struggle to protect
their religion in the
majority against the minority.


I remember going to Bosnia after the end of the war in Bosnia, and a woman
telling
me that she couldn't believe the hostility she started to feel from her
neighbors. And she
said to a neighbor, why are you behaving like this? You know, we've known
each other for
many years. We went to school together. We went to weddings. We buried
our dead
together. Why are you treating me like this? And the answer was, because we
were told if
we didn't do that to you first, you would do it to us.


So if the government doesn't step in and say, no, we're not going to let
   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




people be

acting this way, we're not going to let them be discriminating, we're not
going to let them be
harming others on the basis of religion or any other characteristic, but
focusing on religion,
it can get out of control of any government.


And then unfortunately, as we know, governments can sometimes stoke
religious
discrimination for their own political reasons. You know, you've got
problems at home, the
economy is not doing so well; let's find an enemy, and let's go find, you
know, those people
over there. They're a different religion. And that gets everybody excited. And
then you can
light a match, and you can't put the fire out.


So I think that we need to be very thoughtful in separating out the problems
posed
by extremism, no matter where they're coming from, and terrorism, from
legitimate religious
differences that should be tolerated, respected and protected.
[00:49:56]


Q: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I'm Randa Fahmy Hudome. I am serving as
general counsel of the American Egyptian Strategic Alliance. We're a new
lobbying
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




organization working to bring together Egypt and the United States in a
stronger alliance.
One of the issues we've been talking to the new Egyptian government about
is this issue of
religious freedom. And we've told them, look to your left, meaning to places
like Jordan,
Lebanon and Palestine, where Muslims and Christians, particularly in
Palestine, have lived in
peace for centuries. And so I'm wondering if your conversations touched
upon that — look
to your fellow Arab countries, where this is not a problem, frankly. And then
just a quick
follow-up question. I appreciate your emphasis on America, but we also have
our problems
here with respect to, of course, Islamophobia, which I'm sure you're very
aware of. And I'm
wondering whether you have any comments about this recent activity in
Congress targeting
one of your own aides.
[00:51:13]


SEC. CLINTON: Well, as to — as to the first question, I think it is important
to look
at the historical precedents. But there's also been a lot of disturbing recent
developments,
with Christians being attacked and driven out of Iraq, Christians in Syria
feeling like they are
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




really going to be at risk almost regardless of what develops in the terrible
conflict that is
now raging, Christians feeling that they're under pressure in lots of places in
the Middle East
where, as you rightly say, they have lived for centuries side by side.


And I think it's — I think it's quite important for us to unpack that. Why is it
happening now? What is it? And of course it's a new political identity; it's an
effort by
Islamists primarily, but not exclusively, to claim democracy, but trying to
figure out how it
fits with their pre-existing frameworks of belief. So there is a lot of tension
and concern
going on right now across the Arab world, particularly in places where
Christians have lived
and would love to continue living. And as several Christians in Egypt told me
— said, you
know, our people have been here; I can trace my family back, you know,
2,000 years; I love
this country; I want to be a part of this country; I want to help build this
country; I just hope
I'm going to be able to.


So it's at this point that leadership is incredibly important. Leaders have to be
active
in stepping in and sending messages about protecting the diversity within
their countries.

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




And frankly, I don't see enough of that. And I want to see more of it. I want
to see more of
it, and we did see some of that in our own country. You know, we saw
Republicans
stepping up and standing up against the kind of assaults that really have no
place in our
politics.
[00:53:30]


So we have to set an example. There's no doubt about that. And we have to
continue doing so. But we also have to expect other leaders to do the same.
And when I
think about how scared so many minorities — religious minorities are all over
the world, and
governments are not — I mean, I believe that governments have a bigger role
to play and
more leverage than they exercise. I think too many governments, particularly
in these fast transitioning
societies where there's so much going on at the same time, too many
governments believe that religious freedom is something you get to after you
deal with
everything else. It's just not a priority for them. And we want to raise it up on
the visibility
list of what they need to be dealing with and to try to send a clear message:
You need to
stand up for the rights of all your people; you are now a leader of a diverse
society. If you're
     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




in Iraq, you need to be protecting every community, not just one or maybe
two at the most.
If you're in Lebanon, you need to be standing up for the rights of everyone
in the
community, every confession. And similarly in Egypt or Pakistan or
Indonesia or China or
India or anywhere, leaders need to be out front saying that and then acting
on it.


So I'm hoping that we will see more actions that move in that direction. And
the
United States will continue to try to push and prod and persuade and then, if
necessary, you
know, look at ways to use consequences that can send a very clear message
that we believe
that you will not be successful, you will not be stable, you will not be secure,
and you will
certainly not have a sustainable democracy.


Let me add one other thought about this, though. I think in some societies
where
we're seeing, to go back to the young man's question, terrorism, extremism
and religion,
there's — there can also be fertile ground out of which that grows if a
government is not
paying attention to the needs of all of its people. So it's not just, we respect
your right to
exercise your religion, but we also are going to have policies that, if you're
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015
     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791693 Date: 11/30/2015




living in northern
Nigeria, you're going to see more development, so that you can not only take
on Boko
Haram on the security front, but you take it on on the economic
development front.
[00:56:22]


There are lots of ways to try to knit this together. And it is probably the most
exciting time, but the most daunting time to be a leader in the world right
now, especially in
these new transitioning democracies, because there is just so many high
expectations that
will be so difficult to meet. So stand for principles, stand for values, gain
people's trust that
you're trying to help their lives improve, and you're going to leave to them
the space they
should have to exercise the most precious, you know, freedoms that any
human being
should have regardless of who their leaders are and begin to make that case.
And the United
States will stand ready to assist in any way possible.


Thank you very much. (Applause.)
