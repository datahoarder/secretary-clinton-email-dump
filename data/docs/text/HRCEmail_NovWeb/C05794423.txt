Dear David,

Sorry for my belated reply, but the answer is "yes". I'd be happy to submit an article. I'm copying Jake so you can
coordinate w him.

So happy to be part of a "boost"--we all need one of those right now. Hope all is as well as it can be--H

Dear Hillary:

I saw Theresa Loar at a reception last night and she was speaking very highly of her friendship with you. I hope all is well.

I am writing now with a request. In June (mid/end) I am guest editing one issue of the New Statesman - a (serious)
British weekly current affairs magazine. This is not the start of a journalistic career! But politics here is pretty stuck and
this is one way of providing some ventilation.

I would love to have an article from you in the magazine (or an interview). It could be about the state of the world
("Why America is not in decline") or "How globalisation can be made progressive". Or it could be more personal - about
your passion for women's empowerment as real foreign policy. Or just "10 things I have learnt as Secretary of State". (I
assume something more political is ruled out.)

Really the choice is yours - but I hope it would be a chance to set out something you care about.

Many thanks. I hope this works out.
It would be a real boost.




David
