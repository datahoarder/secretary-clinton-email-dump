Madame Secretary

I participated in Melanne's LMI Women's Empowerment event in Siem Reap the last two days. Another example of the
success of the simple power to convene. The reps from different LMI countries really seemed to be drawn to share
information and practical examples of success.

I did a panel w Goldman Sachs, Coke, and Proctor and Gamble and although it was a good panel it seems from the
questions that the participants need to be given permission to collaborate with the private sector. It follows the theme
that GPI has been promoting of cross sectoral collaboration. Whatever you can do to push that idea would be great. Its
is a simple and necessary message to say to these new entrants into the economy. Participants at both the ASEAN biz
community and the women's empowerment group need to be encouraged to do this.

I sat w the Laos delegation of women and I cannot tell you how powerful your simple trip to Laos was. They were totally
empowered. We have to keep that going. Btw, the Laotian/US Diaspora was present and quite creative.

Off to Burma.

Kris
