TEGUCIGALPA, June 30 (Reuters) - An interim government set up after a military coup in Honduras said it will
send a delegation of politicians, business leaders and lawyers to Washington on Wednesday for talks on the
crisis.                                                                            •
   Roberto Micheletti, sworn in as caretaker president after leftist President Manuel Zelaya was toppled by
the army on Sunday, announced the mission after Zelaya traveled to New York and Washington to address the
United Nations and Organization of American States.
