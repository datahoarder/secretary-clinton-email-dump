We just addressed with hrc.
Matt isn't part of the process and said he didn't want to get into this lane, he was filling in for Sarah who is out today.
This is no longer a regular meeting so when it does need to be scheduled lona will add accordingly.

I addressed this with Lippert when we last had an issue.
Our identified point of contact is Sarah Farnsworth and we talk to her regularly. I will call and find out what happened
but this meeting was confirmed. They are not telling us when things get canceled and I think we need another contact
there if sarah is too overwhelmed.

I arrived for the 10:15 mtg and was told there was no mtg. Matt said they had "released" the time. This is the second
time this has happened. What's up???
