Subject: Re Mid East

I'm continuing to speak to Israelis and Palestinians about a new draft. I can up date you.
Also I think there would be support amongst Arabs for a Partnership Agreement for Egypt that tied in financial help with
commitments to reform from the egyptians. When I was in Egypt there was also support for this concept. I've discussed
with David Cameron also.
Hope all well with you Best Tony
