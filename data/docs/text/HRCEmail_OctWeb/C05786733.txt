Subject: Mediation support

Below is a note written to me by a staffer of mine along with a staffer in 10:

The Specter Letter somewhat misunderstood the purpose of the UN's Mediation Support Unit
(MSU). The MSU provides technical experts who can give support UN mediators, not the
mediators themselves. Essentially, the MSU has on-call outside experts (academics, think
tanks, etc.) in things like constitutional drafting, revenue sharing mechanisms, etc., so
that when a UN mediator needs technical expertise to finish brokering a deal between two
parties, he has someone/someones to turn to.

In the UN system, mediation itself is generally done by a Secretary-General appointed Special
Representative, Special Envoy, or other individual (eg, al-Khatib); it is that individual who
calls on the MSU when needed. These Representatives are the kinds of individuals with the
stature and title clout to actually broker deals.
