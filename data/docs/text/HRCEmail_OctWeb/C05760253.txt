Jack, Cheryl and Jake: I wanted to flag for you a challenge to manage.                                     as we were
drafting the Somalia paper, for State to make a recommendation and to know if the Secretary had seen/cleared the
paper. I was very careful to equivocate, noting that this document had been reviewed on the 7th floor with D Lew, D
Steinberg and P Burns staff all at various meetings and constantly saying (as the paper does) that these are decisions
tha            will need to take jointly understanding all of the repercussions.
