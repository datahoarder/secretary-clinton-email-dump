Mon night/Tues morning: Even in death -- which is a clause I somehow willed myself to believe I would never actually
write about Richard, despite the catastrophic events of the past few days, since it seemed truly impossible to silence
such a passionate, determined, larger than life presence -- Richard brought people together and inspired them. As the
devastating news quickly circulated around 8:00, many of us in Washington spontaneously gathered in the hospital
lobby, shocked and tearful. Just a few hours earlier, the situation had appeared fairly unchanged from my last update
Sunday night, and the President had told a large assemblage at the State Department, joined by Kati and the family, that
"the United States is safer and the world is more secure because of the half century of patriotic service of Ambassador

Richard Holbrooke." And just 45 minutes before, Frank Wisner had called from Texas, continuing as always to rally and
encourage us, and fresh off a call with Misha Saakashvili where he implored the "the world needs Richard Holbrooke."

And yet we found ourselves in the lobby bleary-eyed and suddenly rudderless, unable to truly comprehend a life without
Richard's force of personality. Dr Najam crossed the lobby, expressing great sadness that they ultimately couldn't save
his life, but remarking that Richard had come into the hospital with such dignity, and ultimately left it with the same
dignity. As always, a cross-section of Richard's life was represented -- from the constant reassuring presence of old
friends like Jim Johnson and Maxine Isaacs, Strobe Talbott, and Martin lndyk and Gahl Burt -- to those many of us who
were so proud to be parts of the various teams/families he created and nurtured at the State Department, USUN, and
elsewhere.

When the Secretary came to the lobby after visiting with the family, she immediately and naturally did what she has
done for the past two years for the SRAP team, and especially for the past 4 days during this health crisis -- provide
inspiration, focus, and support. She spoke of the need to celebrate Richard's life, while also continuing the work he
cared so much about at this critical time. Over the coming days we'll determine how we can best collect stories and
memories that reflect every aspect of Richard's personality to properly remember and honor him. As any plans develop,
particularly by the State Department, we will keep you apprised, no doubt helmed by Rosemarie and Ashley, in close
consultation with Kati and the family. To a silenced group, the Secretary then read out loud the following poignant and
heartfelt statement, still in the lobby, so capturing the uniqueness and importance of Richard's unparalleled life.

As we began to tell stories about Richard in the lobby, from how we first met him to his idiosyncratic flying habits,
Maureen White suggested we move as her guests to the bar of the Ritz Carlton. For the next three hours, joined by the
Secretary and other top State Department officials, the SRAP team began the celebration of Richard's life and the
previously unthinkable contemplation of our own lives without him (joined virtually at one point by Les Gelb, as a part of
our family, since his mentorship meant so much to many of us). As I said then, among Richard's final words on the way
to the hospital were his continued appreciation of our team as "the best he had ever worked with." I feel truly blessed
and privileged that I had this unique opportunity to join it and learn so much from him and the other remarkable people
he assembled, which will forever enrich my own life.

If you have thoughts, messages, or prayers, feel free to send them to me, and I will safeguard or forward them as
appropriate. I'm also happy to use this distro list for other messages in the coming days that people may want to post.
Pasted below are the Secretary's statement, the President's statement, and finally, a special request by Lizzie, who sent
the "Man in the Arena," writing, "it is very fitting for Richard and will perhaps mark the beginning of our carrying on his
legacy with greater, though pained, hearts."

With heartfelt prayers, great love and affection, and true sorrow. Dan



STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Tonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke served
the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and high-level peace
talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind -- a true statesman -- and
that makes his passing all the more painful.

From his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in Afghanistan and
Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future. He was the
consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values even under the
most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond, helping mentor generations of
talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark on the State Department or our
country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe, people have a better chance of a peaceful
future because of Richard's lifetime of service.

I had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As Secretary of
State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the State Department and
for the United States of America.

True to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his friends,
that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to everyone who sat
by his side or wished him well in these final days.

Tonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-children
Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and colleagues.



STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA

Michelle and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Richard Holbrooke, a true giant of American foreign policy who has
made America stronger, safer, and more respected. He was a truly unique figure who will be remembered for his tireless
diplomacy, love of country, and pursuit of peace.

For nearly 50 years, Richard served the country he loved with honor and distinction. He worked as a young foreign
service officer during the Vietnam War and then supported the Paris peace talks which ended that war. As a young
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, he helped normalize relations with China. As U.S.
Ambassador to Germany, he helped Europe emerge from a long Cold War and encouraged NATO to welcome new
members.

As Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, he was the tireless chief architect of the Dayton
Accords that ended the war in Bosnia 15 years ago this week, saving countless lives. As Ambassador to the United
Nations, Richard helped break a political impasse and strengthen our nation's relationship with the UN and elevated the
cause of AIDS and Africa on the international agenda. And throughout his life, as a child of refugees, he devoted himself
to the plight of people displaced around the world.

When I became President, I was grateful that Richard agreed to serve as Special Representative for Afghanistan and
Pakistan. The progress that we have made in Afghanistan and Pakistan is due in no small measure to Richard's relentless
focus on America's national interest, and pursuit of peace and security. He understood, in his life and his work, that our
interests encompassed the values that we hold so dear. And as usual, amidst his extraordinary duties, he also mentored
young people who will serve our country for decades to come. One of his friends and admirers once said that, "If you're
not on the team and you're in his way, God help you." Like so many Presidents before me, I am grateful that Richard
Holbrooke was on my team, as are the American people.

Earlier this evening at the State Department, I met with Richard's wife Kati and their family, David, Anthony, Lizzie,
Christopher and Sarah, and I spoke to Kati after Richard's passing. I expressed to them the gratitude of the American
people for his lifetime of service. They are in our thoughts and prayers tonight. Tonight, there are millions of people
around the world whose lives have been saved and enriched by his work. As I said earlier this evening, the United States
is safer and the world is more secure because of the half century of patriotic service of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.



"THE MAN IN THE ARENA"

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,

and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and
timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

In line with the medical assessment, State Dept spokesman PJ Crowley released this additional statement about
Richard's health this evening: "Ambassador Richard Holbrooke remains in critical condition at George Washington
University Hospital, where he is surrounded by his family, friends, colleagues and staff. Today, Ambassador Holbrooke
underwent an additional procedure to improve circulation following yesterday's surgery. Today Ambassador
Holbrooke's wife, Kati Marton, received calls from President Karzai and President Zardari; Secretary Clinton also spoke
with President Karzai. His family is grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers coming in from his many friends,
colleagues and leaders around the world."

The entire family is here now, with not only Kati but all 4 children and step-children, which has been great. Given the
sheer numbers, the hospital's continuing security, and Richard's delicate situation in the ICU, where he's prone to
infection, we're seeking to have only the family on the 2nd floor ICU holding room. Everyone else has been congregating
                                                                    on the ground floor lobby, with the family straddling both         B6
the ground and second floors. When I was last there around 7 pm, Sen Kerry remarked that it looked like a convention,
with the mix of 30-40 old friends from all facets of his life (including the omnipresent Jim Johnson, who has been a rock),
from politics to media to finance, as well as family and staffers. Many of us remarked on how much he'll enjoy hearing
about all the many hours of hallway conversation that have been devoted to him. An SRAP and State Department team

staffed the lobby all day Sunday, and will continue to do so in the coming days in roughly 2-3 hour shifts. They can help
notify the family when visitors come, and keep any visitors engaged if the family isn't available. Chris LaVine is helming
that schedule.

We all continue to be buoyed by the messages of support and strength, and the prayers that have flooded in from
around the world. Our office is keeping a log of all those, and will prepare a book of them for Richard, Kati, and the
family. Personal notes that arrived today included from the UN SYG, and from FMs Davutoglu, Judeh, Aboulgheit, and
Rudd.

We continue to add names of many old and new friends of Richard and Kati's to this list, but please also continue to
remember that any information in this is intended solely for this limited group, and not for public consumption or media

                          IICH is "inching in the right direction," though remains in critical condition. He will brief the
                                                                                                                               B6
family again in the next few hours about his status.
                 After his brief, Ashley will work on an updated State Department release about today's procedure, his
general status, and the great appreciation of his family, friends, and staff for the international outpouring of support
that is being received. In addition to the calls today from Presidents Karzai and Zardari to Kati, as well as calls that the
Secretary has made to foreign leaders, Gen Petraeus, Amb Sedwill and Ashraf Ghani all issued statements today in Kabul
expressing concern and support for RCH, and similar public statements were made by Pakistani senior officials. We
continue to log and respond to numerous calls from his international counterparts and other foreign leaders.

An SRAP team organized a rotational schedule in the hospital lobby today which worked out quite well, and we'll
continue it in the coming days. Chris LaVine has the lead on planning that.

This list has been updated to include additional friends and colleagues of Richard and Kati's, so please use this most
recent version for any further updates, so there aren't varying chains. Please also remember it is not for further public
dissemination, though let me know if there are people who should be added to it.

At 11 am President Karzai called and reached Kati, and as she spoke with him, President Zadari beeped in! He has just
called her back and they're on now. Pres Karzai extended his prayers and thoughts and said, "please tell your husband
that we need him back in afghanistan." And when kati told him that richard's last words before surgery were about
afghanistan, he said "oh my god, oh my god...please tell him to get well fast. We all need him."

Sun 11:00 am update -- Richardi




Kati and the family are still on the 2nd floor by the ICU, but as numerous people are stopping by to express concern, who
can't get upstairs due to security, we've also arranged for a rotation of staff and friends to stay in the lobby to meet with
them, and relay any messages to the family. For today, Rina and Chris have already been there since 8, Donna and I will
be there from roughly 11-2, and Vali and Jake from 2-5. Chris LaVine is managing that schedule, and will add others to it
if they'd like.

Particularly since yesterday's POTUS statement, calls by Presidents Obama and Clinton, and the greatly appreciated
multiple visits by Secretary Clinton, Adm Mullen, Tom Donilon, Raj Shah and others, which helped to buoy spirits, the
number of calls and inquiries from foreign leaders and dignitaries has increased significantly. Cameron Munter just
called again from Pakistan, and reported that he has spoken with all the Pakistani leadership, and President Zardari in
particular has expressed great concern and emotion, calling multiple times to check in on his close friend, and hopes to
speak with Kati soon. President Karzai has also released a statement, and FM Rassoul has reached out to S and Kati. The
UN SYG, numerous FMs, and many others have also sent personal messages, which we're tracking in a database that the
staffers are keeping, and we'll make sure to respond to all.

We've also reached out to RCH's International Contact Group colleagues, key Members of Congress (John Kerry has
called several times), and close friends. Frank Wisner has been phenomenal as always in serving as the link with old

friends and family, and took a group to dinner last night. Among those who stopped by yesterday were Jim Johnson, Liz
and George Stevens, Christianne Amanpour, Walter and Ann Pincus, Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn, Rosenblatts, Nicholas
Platts, etc. Marvin Kalb has called a number of times to check in, and asked to send his thoughts to Kati, along with
numerous friends and former colleagues (Michael Steiner, Chris Hill, Bob Orr). And of course Les and Judy receive
frequent updates.

Adding a few others from State, SRAP, and close friends. We'll continue to send updates, particularly on the ongoing
operation.

She had nothing significant to report, but said whenever the family is back, they'll do an update briefing. So hopefully no
news is stable news.

I'm still at the hospital, with Frank R, Chris L, and John Silson. Sarah and Chris J are out for a quick break. Jim Steinberg
is on the 2nd floor, along with Frank Wisner. Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn came by to say hello, but just stayed in the
lobby. Marvin Kalb somehow got through to the ICU desk by phone, by saying he was a member of the family.

Adding Sarah H and Frank W to this.

Ops is compiling a list of calls received, which we'll address. Zardari would like to speak with Kati, if she wants, and
according to Frank, Z has called Haqqani at least 3 times asking for updates, and there is some organized prayer event
for him in Pak.

 Adding Frank, Vikram, Maureen, Chris, and also Samantha, who's currently with Kati at RCH's house.



 At 2:30 pm, all is quiet at the hospital. Just Vali, Rina, me, Chris in the lobby, with Frank Wisner.



LNo update on RCH, which David and Sarah took as a good sign.L



 Sarah liked S's idea of having shifts from SRAP here, particularly to man the lobby, in case people drop by to visit, so they
 can run interference for the family. And if there's anyone who the family really wants to see, they can let them know.
 Maybe Chris or staffers can put together a schedule for coverage with 1 or 2 staffers/friends at a time, for 3-4 hours at a
 pop?

 We're also logging increased calls now, and staffers are tracking those and we're starting responses. I've also got a list of
 various other calls to proactively make -- USG, State, Hill, foreign officials, etc. -- which we should divvy up.
