We should be okay for 6pm -- our lead USSS says it is just drizzling in Chappaqua now and skies are brightening. The Air
Force will have an update at 4pm.

What about the shuttle? Are they also on time? I don't mind taking one this afternoon.

I just heard back from Mark -- due to crew rest issues today, they cannot move our departure time earlier and we have
to keep with 6:00pm. We will monitor storms so you don't leave home too early if something is rolling through.

I just heard back from the team -- they are monitoring the storms but do not foresee a problem right now. I said I would
check in with them at 1:00pm and will report back.

I'm worried about the weather forecasts for thunderstorms. Can you pls check if I should leave earlier (or later?) to be
safe?

They can basically do whatever you'd like -- should we say 6:00pm?

Bill can't get home until late tomorrow so is there any chance I could either leave later or take a later shuttle?
