Can you talk about timing later? I should be free after 6:30 if you have any time.

I spoke to Liz this morning and explained where we are in terms of the interagency and green lighting invitations (i.e.,
very close, but not there yet). She said that at this point we will probably not be able to attract the number and level of
corporate leaders we originally envisioned for next Tuesday. Liz certainly could pull together something with USGLC
board members and some military leadership, but if she is to only get one bite of the apple with HRC her
recommendation is to "do it right" and move this to January (either the week of the 10th or 24th). The idea in January
would be to include members of congress and frame the event as the QDDR making the case for State/USAID's mission
and resources in the new environment. We could take the event in a number of directions (Liz would LOVE to get Gates
together with Clinton) but the idea to launch the QDDR in January with USGLC as the blueprint for supporting
international affairs and the 150 account.




Thoughts? -D
