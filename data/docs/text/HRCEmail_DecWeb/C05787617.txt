I'm on the phone right now w. La Hood. He called                                  I told him Anne was working it. He's
anxious to get his son out of Egypt. Pls keep me informed.

Let's see if we can resolve it ourselves today/tomorrow. If not, we will bring in the heavy guns. Tomorrow, we need
to find out who else is on the list.

Secretary LaHood may be calling                about his son, Sam, who was prohibited from leaving on his flight
tonight. Apparently, he is on the exit control list, and there may be others. I think we have a decent chance of
resolving this tomorrow if we can keep it out of the press. We got hints earlier in the day that there might be

Lorne told me that Secretary LaHood had some ideas, and Lorne had urged him to call
