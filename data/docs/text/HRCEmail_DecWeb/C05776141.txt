From the American People

By Rajiv Shah

Americans recognize that our security and prosperity depend on having stable global partners, able to contribute to
solving shared problems. Americans also know that our influence in the world and our ability to rally peoples and
nations around common challenges rests in large measure on our reputation as a beacon of humanity and human
dignity.

We saw our common humanity in action earlier this year when nearly half of American households contributed to the
Haiti earthquake response. In fact, more people gave money to Haiti relief efforts this year than watched the Super
Bowl.

American rescue and response teams, backed by USAID, were in Haiti just hours after the devastating earthquake, lifting
survivors from the rubble. They were among the first to respond to deadly earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan, and to a
devastating tsunami in Thailand. And most recently, they were the first to arrive in Pakistan assisting the millions
displaced by devastating floods.

These disaster response teams represent America at its best, projecting the true character of our country to nations in
their hour of need.

Heroic efforts on behalf of the American people play out every day in countries around the world. America's emergency
response efforts complement a long-term development agenda that supports developing nations as they grow their way
out of poverty.

Administrations ofboth political parties have supported these efforts, even in difficult economic times, because we
recognize that it is both the right thing to do, and the smart and strategic thing to do. That is why United States
emergency aid is stamped with the phrase "from the American people" in local languages. The logo of the U.S. Agency

for International Development is an image of a handshake, and it has become known around the world as a sign of
partnership and promise. I am enormously proud whenever I visit a health clinic, school or refugee camp and see that
handshake in action.

Displaying our logo is also a matter of transparency. We believe that people in Haiti, Pakistan and elsewhere have a right
to know where their assistance is coming from. And American taxpayers have a right to know where their dollars are
going. International aid operations can be complex, with many organizations, local officials and donor nations working
together. Transparency helps reduce the chances that funds and supplies are misdirected or misused.

We recognize that in certain geographic areas this policy can create risks and challenges for courageous aid workers
operating under already difficult circumstances, including some from non-governmental organizations and charities that
do not have the resources or protection of official government agencies.

That is why we carefully tailor our decisions on where and how much to label aid to the risks in any given area. We
closely monitor evidence of security threats and, when necessary for the safety of workers, provide waivers that allow
them to distribute unlabeled aid. We do this in the most dangerous areas of Pakistan.

When we place our name on the supplies we send, we are sending a public message that we believe in a bright future
for places facing great challenges today. We are on the ground with our sleeves rolled up, working as friends and
partners, because we see the promise and possibilities that future holds.

The Obama Administration is committed to the safety of our partners in the aid community. At the same time, we need
to be honest and transparent about America's commitments, for our people's sake and theirs. Wherever possible, we
will extend our hand openly and confidently and label our assistance, "From the American People."

Chris and team,

Thanks for the great feedback. Just did another round on this. Take a look. I think we're in good shape. Raj signed off on
previous version so we can go forward with this as final. It's also now the perfect length at 600 words.

One note, I took out the "...but we will not shrink" line. It was too combative and would only provoke NGO community.
It was also redundant with last graph so I combined them. I think it works and it still maintains an assertive stance.

Thanks, ben

We just discussed the op-ed with Judith, PJ, Larry, and Kitty. Couple of tracked changes in the doc to make sure we're
just re-stating policy and not going to far as to give the impression we were considering/making policy shifts that would
put people at risk. Also, we believe that the Chile topper doesn't quite fit. If the idea is to broaden this from Pakistan, a
focus on Haiti to open and close would provide a better fit for an example as our involvement in Chile was not as robust.

Thanks,

Chris

All,

Op-ed attached and pasted below. Apols for delay. I was told this morning we had a Miami Dade team in Chile, but turns
out that wasn't true (someone was wearing one of their t-shirts on TV). Made some adjustments so the hook still works.
This is all clear on our side. Raj hasn't reviewed, but since time is short, I think it's safe to start pitching. And of course,
let me know if you have any changes on your end.

Thanks, Ben

The American Idea in Action

By Rajiv Shah




The striking imagery of Tuesday night's dramatic rescue operation in northern Chile is now familiar to all. The inspiring
story of survival—of families reunited and the pride and passion of a nation on display—brought the world together in a
rare moment of unity and celebration.

One image out of view of most cameras—but not unfamiliar to those of us who work in emergency response—was that
of the brave Chilean search and rescue experts, working through the night to help bring the miners to the surface.

Rescue specialists like these are regularly deployed by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and are
among the first to respond to disasters around the world.

American rescue teams, backed by USAID, were in Haiti just hours after the devastating earthquake, lifting survivors
from the rubble. They were among the first on the scene after deadly earthquakes in Tehran, Turkey and Taiwan. And
they have trained thousands of their counterparts around the world.

These first-responders represent America at its best, projecting the true character of our country to nations in their hour
of need.

Heroic efforts on behalf of the American people play out every day in countries around the world. America's emergency
response efforts complement a long-term development agenda that supports developing nations as they grow their way
out of poverty.

Administrations of both political parties have supported these efforts, even in difficult economic times, because we
recognize that it is both the right thing to do, and the smart and strategic thing to do.

Americans understand this too. In today's interconnected world, our own security and prosperity depends on having
stable global partners, able to contribute to solving shared problems. When millions of girls are denied an education,
when floods leave families destitute and dislocated, when the dignity of work or the promise of prosperity is out of
grasp for one third of the humanity, it harms our own prosperity and security.

Americans also recognize that our influence in the world and our ability to rally peoples and nations around common
challenges rests in large measure on our reputation as a beacon of humanity and human dignity.

We saw our common humanity in action earlier this year when more than half of American households contributed to
the Haiti earthquake response. In fact, this year more people gave money to Haiti relief efforts than watched the Super
Bowl.

The aid workers who used this assistance to set up shelters in Haiti, or who are currently distributing food, clean water
and shelter materials in flood affected Pakistan, help translate our compassion into tangible expressions of America's
character and commitment.




That is why United States emergency aid is stamped with the phrase "from the American people" in local languages. The
logo of the U.S. Agency for International Development is an image of a handshake, and it has become known around the

world as a sign of partnership and promise. I am enormously proud whenever I visit a health clinic, school or refugee
camp and see that handshake in action.

Displaying our logo is also a matter of transparency. We believe that people in Haiti, Pakistan and elsewhere have a right
to know where their assistance is coming from. And American taxpayers have a right to know where their dollars are
going. International aid operations can be complex, with many organizations, local officials and donor nations working
together. Transparency helps reduce the chances that funds and supplies are misdirected or misused.

We recognize that in certain areas this policy can create risks and challenges for courageous aid workers operating
under already difficult circumstances, including some from non-governmental organizations and charities who do not
have the resources or protection of official government agencies.

That is why we carefully tailor our decisions on where and how much to label aid to the risks in any given area. We
closely monitor evidence of security threats and, when necessary for the safety of workers, provide waivers that allow
them to distribute unlabeled aid. We do this in some of the most dangerous areas of Pakistan.

We will not allow our policies to endanger the men and women who risk their lives to help others in times of greatest
need. But wherever it can be done without putting lives at risk, we must extend our hand openly and confidently to the
people of the world.

When we place our name on the supplies we send, we are sending a public message that we believe in the future of
Haiti, of Pakistan, and of so many other places where today the challenges are great. We are on the ground with our
sleeves rolled up, working as friends and partners, because we see the promise and possibilities that future holds.

The Obama Administration is committed to the safety of our brave partners in the aid community. Decisions on how to
label assistance will always be made weighing that commitment. But we also need to be honest and transparent about
America's commitments, for our people's sake and theirs.

So as the camera crews return home from Chile this week, and the world rejoices in this human triumph, let us also
celebrate the quiet and steady efforts of the courageous Americans who are helping to save lives, ease human suffering
and project the goodness and decency of the American people around the world. They are putting the "American idea"
into action — creating opportunity for all and honoring our responsibilities to our fellow man.
