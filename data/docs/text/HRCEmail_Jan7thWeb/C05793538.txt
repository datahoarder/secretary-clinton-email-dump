Subject: Haiti Trip January 2012



Mike and I just returned from Haiti, where we had an amazingly successful
trip. We had no problem getting the 500 Breadfruit plants into Haiti, we had
all the US quarantine plant documentation ready to show the customs officers
at the airport. The customs officers were so excited to see the plants and
thanked us for bringing them. They also asked for a few samples! We were met
at the airport by Floresta Haiti and Three Angels Children's Relief.
Floresta Haiti is a well established reforestation organization and are
happy to partner with us to plant the breadfruit trees in rural areas.

Three Angels Children's Relief has offered to collect future shipments of
plants and grow them for 4 months before distributing them to groups for
planting. They have very experienced agronomy staff and hope to set up a
plant nursery. We visited many potential growing areas and made sure that
the growers can secure a good growing environment and be accountable for the
trees they receive.

A lovely Haitian lady and friend,
                                                The hotel is recovering
after the 2010 earthquake which collapsed a 5 story building collapsed
killing many people including her 7 year old grandson.          has expressed
a commitment to helping us on a long term basis. She helped us set up a
meeting on the grounds. We met under an ancient mahogany tree and over 30
people came. Most were Haitian and many were young and all were excited to
hear and help. We showed breadfruit products that are being made in Jamaica,
Barbados and Indonesia with very low tech equipment.

We discovered that the varieties of existing breadfruit trees in Haiti are
not as good a variety as those of the Pacific and Jamaica so the
introduction of new Ma'afala variety will be very beneficial.

Recipients of the donated trees included three orphanages, the new botanical
Gardens, watershed restoration groups, other small organizations and a few
interested individuals. The need and interest in breadfruit is so great.

We were very pleased with the trip. We hope to be able to ship in 1000 trees
a month by the end of the year. If we can sustain that number for 10 years

we will reach our goal of 1 million trees and achieve year round sustainable
breadfruit production, and a local market.

Thanks for your support.
