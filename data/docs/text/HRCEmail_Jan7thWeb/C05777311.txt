Colleagues-

Attached is cable Moscow 297 (February 2010, attached) regarding USAID Moscow's presentation to the GoR about
contracting opportunities (I have the USAID presentation in Russian, if anyone wants it). I note that the Russian
company Zarubezhtransstroi, the original builder of the Salang Tunnel in 1964, did indeed participate in this USAID
briefing in Moscow and bid on (but lost) the recent contracts for the emergency repair work. Thus, it does not appear
that Russian firms were "kept from bidding," as Lavrov apparently said to Secretary Clinton.

In addition, it seems that the USAID contracting officer gave some good information and advice during the February
presentation in Moscow, although Zarubezhtransstroi apparently did not partner with a local firm on its bid:

        "Participants were given a list of anticipated USAID competitive contracting opportunities in Afghanistan for
        FY2010, and names and contact information for USAID's implementing partners in Afghanistan. The presenters
        also described Embassy Kabul's and U.S. Forces Afghanistan's "Afghan First" policy, which encourages local
        procurement of Afghan goods and services to benefit and improve the well-being of the Afghan people."

        "The Contracting Officer ...did point out the potential benefits of sub-contracting with companies who were
        currently working in Afghanistan. She also remarked that forming consortium companies was not prohibited."




For Kabul colleagues, please note that the MoPW already held a donors conference on March 30 to discuss the Salang
Tunnel, and your predecessors submitted the following comment in Kabul 1130 (April 1, attached):

        8. (SBU) Comment: We will consult with the Russian Embassy about this issue before the next donors meeting
        on April 6. Additionally, we continue to work internally to think of other ways we can be involve Russian firms in
        this project short of promising a sole source contract. We will also think through means to build broader donor
        support for this project. End comment.

On the issue of whether the GIRoA would welcome a Russian firm, I refer you to Kabul 747 (March 1, attached), in which
Minister Zakhilwal stated the following:

         3. (SBU) When asked about Afghan public perceptions on Russian involvement in Afghanistan, Finance Minister
         Zakhilwal responded: "we welcome it." ... He also said that projects such as the Salang tunnel could be
         interesting for qualified Russian firms. Zakhilwal said that the President shared his views on Russian
         engagement."

 Many thanks for your efforts on this project, and for your sensitivity to Russian concerns that have been raised by
 President Medvedev and other Russian officials. As long as the playing field is level and Russian firms are given an equal

All,
Please see below and attached for further information from Jerry Smith, the USAID contracting officer for Salang
Tunnel. The attached document includes the names of the Afghan subcontractors: Engineering, Construction &
Highway Construction Organization (ECHCO) and Erector Construction & Road Building Company-Golden City
Construction Company (ECRC-GCC JV). Many thanks to Jerry for his response to your questions:


"I was completely unaware of the discussions with the Russians. I suspect that LBGBV was not aware of it either. Even if
they were, they have to follow their procurement policies and procedures which require a fair opportunity to all
interested parties to bid. As a matter of USAID policy we strongly encourage LBGBV, to the maximum extent possible,
make awards to local Afghan firms. LBGBV posts their procurement oppoi.tunities on various web sites and local
newspapers. They will also invite contractors who have previously done work (successfully) with them to bid on the
projects as well. The Russian companies who are interested in opportunities in Afghanistan must understand the market

and know where to find these opportunities. It would be contrary to the USAID and "Afghan First" policy to actively
recruit companies from Russia to do work which local Afghan firms are fully qualified to do.

For this project, 4 subcontracts were contemplated. Two Afghan firms were awarded subcontracts. One of these firms
received two of the four subcontracts. The 4th subcontract was to an Uzbekistan company. I rejected this company
because its mobilization costs were way too high for the work to be done and the subcontractor could not justify these
costs. LBGBV was instructed to rebid this subcontract. Total cost for the work is $5M. Total value for each subcontract is
$1M each. The remaining costs are LBGBV's security, program management and OH costs.

I will have to ask LBGBV to provide me with the bidders list in order to determine if any Russian firms submitted a bid. It
is clear that companies outside of Afghanistan were aware of the offer to bid as an Uzbekistan company submitted a bid.

As an aside, the MoPW is a partner in making the repairs to the tunnel and the galleys. How would the Afghan
Government react if a Russian firm showed up on the job site? If the Russian firm desires to import workers it would be
difficult for them to obtain work visas from the Afghan government.

Unfortunately I am getting on a flight to Jalalabad in a few minutes and will not have the information from LBGBV until I
return on Saturday.

See attached for additional information on the Salang tunnel project."

It seems to me our next step is for Jerry or Ito get back to you when we have information from LBG on whether any
Russian firms submitted a bid. If Russia did submit a bid, their complaint is not legit. If Russia did not submit a bid, the
failure might have been on our end, i.e. for State to have communicated with AID, and via AID with LBG, to ensure the
Russians were aware of how to submit a bid on this particular project. As Jerry suggests, however, that communication
should have stopped short of active recruitment. (But if USAID gave a presentation in Moscow as Tom describes, it looks
like we covered this base?)

Hope this answers some questions.

Best,
Kate

Kate is right about Embassy efforts to educate the Russians about USG contracting. In fact, there are cables about
discussions in Kabul with the Russians (including one that I attended with Ambassador Wayne to visit the Russian
Ambassador to Afghanistan). USAID even gave a presentation in Moscow to the Russians on how to bid on USAID
contracts.




Nobody (except the Russians) has suggested at any time that a Russian firm be given a sole source contract. But I can
say that the USG has repeatedly led the GOR to believe that Russian firms would have a fair opportunity to bid.

Based on information from three Embassy and AID people involved here (including the contracting officer at AID), the
bottom line is that no, the Russians were not kept from bidding. Dan's exactly right that they (repeatedly) requested a
sole source contract, and we repeatedly said no. Moreover, Amb. Todd's deputy and our Ambassadors (I don't know
which) repeatedly told the Russians that they were able to bid.

More context:
The AID contracting officer, Gerry Smith, reports that there are three stages of work to be done:
   • Salang Tunnel Emergency Repair (Task Order 14): To make the tunnel safer by tunnel repair, galleys repair, and
       electrical work. Louis Berger Group is the prime contractor. The bidding process was on an accelerated
       timeline because Louis Berger said the work needed to get done before winter, but Louis Berger doesn't restrict
       bids. It was a closed (anonymous) bidding process that lasted about 30 days, and the Russians were in no way
       denied the ability to bid. The contract has been awarded, and work is underway.
   • Bypass Road (Bamiyan to Dushi Rd): This road must be built before long-term repair work can be done. The
       road will take 3 years. This contract is not/not yet awarded. Louis Berger submitted the Request For Proposals,
       and collected bids. Bidding closed 2-3 weeks ago. We then told them, do not/not open the bid
       packages...because we decided this project will go on-budget, i.e. through the GIRoA in some mechanism
       (maybe ARTF, maybe not). Therefore no one yet knows who bid on the project.

    •       Long-term repair work: We have not gotten to this stage yet; it's entirely conceptual. No design work done. All
            discussion. Because the road will take 3 years to build, we have 3 years to design this third stage.

Just let me know if you need further details, like who won the bid, etc., or more on timelines.

All best,
Kate

I wasn't in the mtg, but Jake said that Lavrov claimed Russian firms were kept from bidding on the first round of Salang Tunnel
bidding, and S said we would seek to remedy that in the next round. But is that accurate? I thought the Russians were looking for a
sole source contract, and we said no. What's happened on this the past few months?
